I'm Zoe, currently a rising 3rd year student at Rochester Institute of Technology enrolled in the Computer Science BS program.
My professional interests are around software development and data analysis.
Some of my personal interests are dodgeball, ceramics, and team based fps games.
Looking for a co-op/internship for the Spring/Summer 2026 blocks.
